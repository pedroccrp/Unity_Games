  BeforePotionDialog:
  - Hello, Sweetie! Are you the Potion Maker that will cure the princess?
  - You know, I tried and failed. So... I don't think that you can do it.
  - It's not that you are bad or anything... The thing is... I'm amazing!
  - So if I couldn't do it, nobody can.
  - You will do what? Prepare a potion to me to prove yourself?
  - Hahaha! People these days, just need to make a show for themselves, right?
  - Fine then. If you make a good potion, I will give you one of mine special Ingredients!
  AfterPotionDialog:
  - Oh Sweetie! This potion is fantastic!
  - It paid off being so showy right? *Giggles*
  - As promised, here it is!
