  BeforePotionDialog:
  - Hi there! You seem like an Expert Potion Maker...
  - So... Tel me... Are you going to cure the Princess?
  - Oh, isn't that lovely? What a nice person you are!
  - And you need what? But I can't give it to you, it's mine, you see?
  - Of course if you prepare one potion for me... I think I can give it to you. (Or
    not hehehe)
  AfterPotionDialog:
  - Thanks for the potion fella! Bye!
  - '*Grabs merchant*'
  - Hey hey! Don't need to be agressive! Here is the ingredient. Geez...
