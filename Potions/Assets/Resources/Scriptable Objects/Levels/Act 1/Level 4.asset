  - Hey, you, Potion Maker! Can you help me?
  - I was guarding this brigde yesterday and a witch came.
  - 'Since I can''t just let everyone pass, I sent her away. '
  - She got really upset and trasformed me into a rabbit...
  - Can you transform me back?
  - And, of course, I will reward you appropriately.
  AfterPotionDialog:
  - Thanks Potion Maker!
  - Now I can go there and kil.....
  - I mean, talk to her and get things done...
  - Anyway, now you can proceed to the Castle, the Princess is waiting for you there.
  - And of course, here is the promised reward. I found it in some dungeon that I
    went to.
  - And for some reason it's a little too cute for his species...
